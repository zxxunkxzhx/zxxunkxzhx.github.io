<h1>rule</h1>
<p>A rule begins with target(s); A goal is the target (or set of targets) that make is asked to build

<p>When a rule has multiple targets, it is equivalent to writing independent rules for <b>each target</b>.

<p>Rule lists some files that the targets depend on, called the prerequisites; such as<pre>
$(BUILDDIR)/%.o: $(SRCDIR)/%.c
    ;
</pre>

<p>Rule may also give a <b>recipe</b> to use to create or update the targets.

<h1>variable definition</h1>
A variable definition is a line that specifies a text string value for a variable.

<h1>directive</h1><ul>
<li>`include filename1 [filename2...]` or `-include filenames...`(sinclude, silent include)
<li>`ifeq ($(CC),gcc)`, ifdef $(foo), ...
<li>Defining Multi-Line Variables, such as <pre>
define two-lines
echo foo
echo $(bar)
endef
</pre>
</ul>

<h1>#</h1><ul>
<li>within variable references: treated literally, such as $(my#var)
<li>within function call: treated literally, such as BAR = $(subst a, b#, foo)
<li>within a recipe: whether or not this is a comment is up to the shell
<li>within a define directive: either be treated as make comments or as recipe text, depending
on the context in which the variable is evaluated
</ul>
