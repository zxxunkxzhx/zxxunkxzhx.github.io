    <title> How make Reads a Makefile  </title>
</head>
<body>
<p>
GNU make does its work in two distinct phases. During the first phase it reads all the
makefiles, included makefiles, etc. and internalizes all the variables and their values and
implicit and explicit rules, and builds a dependency graph of all the targets and their
prerequisites. During the second phase, make uses this internalized data to determine which
targets need to be updated and run the recipes necessary to update them.

<p>
Itâ€™s important to understand this two-phase approach because it has a direct impact on
how variable and function expansion happens.

<p>
We say that expansion is immediate if expansion happens during the first phase: make will expand
that part of the construct as the makefile is parsed.

<p>We say that expansion is deferred if it is not immediate. Expansion of a deferred construct part is delayed until the expansion is
used: <b>either when it is referenced in an immediate context, or when it is needed during the
second phase.</b>
