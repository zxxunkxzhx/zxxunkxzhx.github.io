Wildcard expansion is performed by make automatically in targets and in prerequisites.
In recipes, the shell is responsible for wildcard expansion. In other contexts, wildcard expansion happens only if you request it explicitly with the wildcard function.

<p>$(wildcard patternâ€¦) is replaced by a space-separated list of names of existing files that match one of the given file name patterns.

<p>a makefile to compile all C source files in the directory and then link them together could be written as follows:<pre>
objects := $(patsubst %.c,%.o,$(wildcard *.c))

foo : $(objects)
        cc -o foo $(objects)
</pre>
