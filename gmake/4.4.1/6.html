    <title> How to Use Variables  </title>
</head>
<body>

<p>A variable is a name defined in a makefile to represent a string of text, called the variable’s value.

<p>Variables and functions in all parts of a makefile are expanded when read, except when:<ul>
<li>in recipes
<li>in the right-hand sides of variable definitions using = or ?=
<li>in right-hand sides of +=: deferred or immediate, depending on its left hand
<li>in the bodies of variable definitions using the define directive: may be immediate when in the body of `define immediate +=`, else deferred
<li><a href=https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Using-Variables>3.7 How make Reads a Makefile</a> has some further details
</ul>

<p>The value a variable expands to is that of its most recent definition at the time of expansion. In other words, variables are dynamically scoped.

<p>A variable name may be <b style=color:red>any sequence of characters</b> not containing ‘:’, ‘#’, ‘=’, or whitespace.
variable names containing characters other than letters, numbers, and underscores should be considered carefully;
Variable names beginning with ‘.’ and an uppercase letter may be given special meaning in future versions of make;
we recommend using lower case letters for variable names that serve internal purposes in the makefile.

<p>we can refer a variable as ${multi-chars-var}, $(multi-chars-var) or $single-char-var (such as $@); to get a literal $ in makefile, we use $$.

<p>keep in mind IN SHELL:<ul style=color:red>
<li>\$ is used to get a literal $
<li>$$ is to get the shell's PID
<li>$(pwd) is to call the prog named pwd(while in Makefile, it's referring the var named pwd); so in recipe, you write $$(pwd) to get result from the pwd util
<li>in shell, $PATH is to get val-of-env-var PATH; while in Makefile, $PATH is to get val-of-var P then append text "ATH"
</ul>
