    <title> Appending More Text to Variables </title>
</head>
<body>

Often it is useful to add more text to the value of a variable already defined. You do this with a line containing ‘+=’ like <i>objects += another.o</i>; 
This takes the value of the variable objects, and adds the text ‘another.o’ to it, <b style=color:red>preceded by a single space, if it has a value already</b>

<p>zxxu: following code will output "hello world." in gmake 4.3,<pre>
var00 :=
var01 := hello
var01 +=world
var01 += ${var00}

first_tgt:
	@echo "enter first_tgt"
	@echo var01=${var01}.
	@echo "exit first_tgt"

</pre>so for gmake 4.3, the single space is added only if the appended text is not empty; AI said the result should be "hello world ." in gmake 4.4, I am not sure about it.
