<body>

Another way to set the value of a variable is to use the define directive.

<p>This directive has an unusual syntax which allows newline characters to be included in the value.

<p>The value to give the variable appears on the following lines. The end of the value is marked by a line containing just the word endef. The final newline before the endef is not included in the value.
