<h1>Substitution References</h1><pre>
 ‘$(var:a=b)’ is equivalent to ‘$(patsubst %a,%b,var)’, which replaces every word in $(var) that ends with a by replacing the suffix a with b

<p>Another <I>type</I> of substitution reference has the same form ‘$(var:a=b)’, except that now <i>a</i> must contain a single ‘%’ character. This case is equivalent to ‘$(patsubst a,b,$(var))’.

<h1>Computed Variable Names</h1>
Variables may be referenced inside the name of a variable. This is called a computed variable name or a nested variable reference. For example,
<pre>
x = y
y = z
a := $($(x))
</pre>
defines a as ‘z’
