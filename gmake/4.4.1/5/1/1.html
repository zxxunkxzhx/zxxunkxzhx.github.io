    <title> Splitting Recipe Lines  </title>
</head>
<body>

<p>One of the few ways in which make does interpret recipes is checking for a backslash just
before the newline. As in normal makefile syntax, a single logical recipe line can be split
into multiple physical lines in the makefile by placing a backslash before each newline. A
sequence of lines like this is considered a single recipe line, and one instance of the shell will
be invoked to run it.

<p>However, in contrast to how they are treated in other places in a makefile, backslash/newline pairs are not removed
from the recipe. Both the backslash and the newline characters are preserved and passed
to the shell( How the backslash/newline is interpreted depends on your shell ).

<p>If the first character of the next line after the backslash/newline is the recipe prefix character (a tab
by default), then that character (and only that character) is removed. For example, <pre>
all :
        @echo no\
space
        @echo no\
        space
        @echo one \
        space
        @echo one\
         space
</pre> consists of four separate shell commands where the output is:<pre>
nospace
nospace
one space
one space
</pre>

<p>As a more complex example, this makefile:
<pre>
all : ; @echo 'hello \
        world' ; echo "hello \
    world"
</pre>according to <b>shell quoting rules</b>(Everything inside single quotes is taken literally by the shell), YOUR shell may yield the following output:
<pre>
hello \
world
hello     world
</pre>
