Don’t assume that . is in the path for command execution.

<p>When you need to run programs that are a part of your package during the make, please make sure that:<ul>
<li> it uses $(srcdir)/ if the file is an unchanging part of the source code.

<li> it uses ./ if the program is built as part of the make
</ul>Without one of these prefixes, the current search path is used.

<p>
The distinction between ./ (the build directory) and $(srcdir)/ (the source directory) is important because users can build in a separate directory using the ‘--srcdir’ option to configure. A rule of the form:
<pre>
foo.1 : foo.man sedscript
        sed -f sedscript foo.man > foo.1
</pre>
will fail when the build directory is not the source directory, because foo.man and sedscript are in the source directory.
