<h1> "Soft hits"  </h1>
"Soft hits" are credit checks that appear on your credit report. They're recorded on your credit report but only you can see them. <b style=color:green>These credit checks don't affect your credit score.</b>

<p>Examples of soft hits include: requesting your own credit report; businesses checking your credit report to update their records about an existing account you have with them

<h1> Improving your credit </h1>
<li> If you use a lot of your available credit(more than 30%), lenders see you as a greater risk. <b>This is true even if you pay your balance in full by the due date.</b>
<li> The longer you have a credit account open and in use, the better it is for your score. <b>Your credit score may be lower if you have credit accounts that are relatively new.</b>
<li> Consider keeping an older account open even if you don't need it. Use it from time to time to keep it active.
<li> <i>get your quotes from different lenders within a 2-week period when shopping around for a car loan or a mortgage. Credit bureaus will combine and treat your inquiries as a single inquiry for your credit score</i>
<li> Reduce "Hard hits" such as: credit card applications; some rental applications; some employment applications
<li> <i>Diversifying your credit: Your score may be lower if you only have one type of credit product, such as a credit card.</i>
