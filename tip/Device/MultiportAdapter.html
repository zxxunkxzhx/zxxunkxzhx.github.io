<h1>Required</h1><ul>
<li><b>Power delivery</b>: > 99W
<li>MicroSD: if you have a SD card, you can take out the MicroSD to read; so if the Multiport Adapter supports MicroSD, it's enough.
<li>USB-A + USB-C > 3
<li>HDMI: HDMI is commonly used in meetings or classrooms to project content from a computer or other device onto a large screen; 4K resolution required
</ul>

<h1>Optional</h1><ul>
<li>RJ45: This kind of cable is very popular, yet normally you already have a RJ45->USB-A Adapter(or you can connect through Wifi)
<li>DisplayPort: HDMI is more popular, when Dp is in need, we can have a HDMI->Dp Adapter
</ul>
