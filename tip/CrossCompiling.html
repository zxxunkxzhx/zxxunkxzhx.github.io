<h1> MSVC </h1>
As is known that MSVC is microsoft "visual" toolchain to develop c(++) apps.

<p>To cross-compile from x64 to arm64, we simply call <i>"Microsoft Visual Studio\...\Build\vcvarsall.bat" x64_arm64</i>

<p>To use build system such as CMake, you call `cmake -G "..." -A ARM64`; pupular CMAKE_VS_PLATFORM_NAME are "ARM64","Win32"(not "x86"!) and "x64".


<h1> GNU C(++) toolchains </h1>
Unlike MSVC, you have to provide a specific tool chain to cross-compile.

<p>When cross-compiling, <b>CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE</b> should set the CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR variable to match target architecture that it specifies.

<p>For MSVC, CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME is always "Windows", yet for gcc toolchains, it can (also) be: Android, Darwin, iOS, Linux, etc; <i style=color:green>note although Android is derived from Linux, we set aside it</i> 


<h1> clang toolchains </h1>
<b style=color:green>Almost all GNU compile options are accepted by clang(LLVM compilier).</b>

<p>If your target arch is apple(such as iMac), you involves clang; clang is tightly integrated with Xcode and supports Apple-specific toolchains like Objective-C and Swift.
