<h1>The 64-bit Execution state</h1><ul>
<li>Provides 31 64-bit general-purpose registers, of which X30 is used as the procedure link register.
<li>Provides a 64-bit Program Counter (PC)
<li>Provides stack pointers (SPs), and Exception Link Registers(ELRs)
<li>Provides 32 128-bit registers for Advanced SIMD vector and scalar floating-point support.
<li>Defines the Armv8 Exception model, with up to four Exception levels, EL0 - EL3, that
provide an execution privilege hierarchy
<li>Defines a number of Process state (PSTATE) elements that hold PE state. The A64
instruction set includes instructions that operate directly on various PSTATE elements.
<li>Names each <b>System register</b> using a suffix that indicates the lowest Exception level at which
the register can be accessed.</ul>


<h1>AArch32</h1><ul>
<li>Provides 13 32-bit general-purpose registers, and a 32-bit PC, SP, and Link Register (LR).
The LR is used as both an ELR and a procedure link register.
<li>Provides a single ELR, for exception returns from Hyp mode.
<li>Provides 32 64-bit registers for Advanced SIMD vector and scalar floating-point support.
<li>Defines a number of Process state (PSTATE) elements that hold PE state. The A32 and T32
instruction sets include instructions that operate directly on various PSTATE elements, and
instructions that access PSTATE by using the Application Program Status Register (APSR)
or the Current Program Status Register (CPSR).</ul>

<h1>Transferring between Execution states</h1>
Transferring control between the AArch64 and AArch32 Execution states is known as interprocessing. The PE can
move between Execution states only on a change of Exception level. This means different software layers, such as an application, an operating system
kernel, and a hypervisor, executing at different Exception levels, can execute in different Execution states.
