<p>AArch32 state provides SIMD instructions in the base instruction sets that operate on the 32-bit general-purpose registers. It also provides Advanced SIMD instructions that operate on registers in the SIMD and floating-point register
(SIMD&FP register) <b>file</b>.

<p>The A64 instruction set does not include SIMD instructions that operate on the general-purpose
registers, therefore, some AArch64 instructions descriptions use SIMD as a synonym for Advanced
SIMD.
