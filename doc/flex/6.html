`.` matches any character(byte) except newline(\n)

<p>The {-} syntax in flex represents set subtraction, such as [a-z]{-}[aeiou]

<p> \a means the bell char

<p> r$ means a pattern <i>r</i> but only at the end of a line. Equivalent to r/\n(for DOS file, use r/\r\n instead of r$; or we can use r$ on any plat but filter out the last \r char which is matched)
