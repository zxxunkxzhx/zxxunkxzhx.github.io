</head>
<body>

The rules section of the flex input contains a series of rules of the form <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;pattern   action<br>
where the pattern must be unindented and the action must begin on the same line.

<p>In the rules section, any indented or %{ %} enclosed text appearing before the first rule may:<ul>
 <li>be used to declare variables which are local to the scanning routine and
 <li>(after the declarations) code which is to be executed whenever the scanning routine is entered.
</ul>

<p>Other indented or %{ %} text in the rule section is still copied to the output
