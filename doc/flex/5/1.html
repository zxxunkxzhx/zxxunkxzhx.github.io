    <title> Format of the Definitions Section  </title>
</head>
<body>
<pre>
The definitions section contains declarations of simple name definitions to simplify the scanner specification, and declarations of start conditions, which are explained in a later section.

Name definitions have the form like:
    DIGIT    [0-9]
    ID       [a-z][a-z0-9]*
A subsequent reference to
    {DIGIT}+"."{DIGIT}*
is identical to
    ([0-9])+"."([0-9])*

An unindented comment is copied verbatim to the output up to the next '*/', any other unindented text are not allowed unless it starts with '%' and can be explained by current version of flex.

Any indented text or text enclosed in '%{' and '%}' is also copied verbatim to the output (with the %{ and %} symbols removed). The %{ and %} symbols must appear unindented on lines by themselves.

A %top{ ... } block is similar to a '%{' ... '%}' block, except that the code in a %top block is relocated to the top of the generated file. Multiple %top blocks are allowed.
