Perl's regular expressions are described in its own documentation, and regular expressions in general are covered in a number of books. <i>Jeffrey Friedl's "Mastering Regular Expressions", published by O'Reilly, covers regular expressions in great detail.</i>

<p>This document discusses the patterns that are supported by PCRE when one its main matching functions, pcre_exec() (8-bit) or pcre[16|32]_exec() (16- or 32-bit), is used. PCRE also has <i>alternative</i> matching functions, pcre_dfa_exec() and pcre[16|32_dfa_exec(), which match using a different algorithm that is not Perl-compatible. The advantages and disadvantages of the alternative functions, and how they differ from the normal functions, are discussed in the <a href=https://www.pcre.org/original/doc/html/pcrematching.html>pcrematching</a> page.

    Outside a character class, the circumflex character is an assertion that is true only if the current matching point is at the start of the subject string(if PCRE_MULTILINE  not set). If the startoffset argument of pcre_exec() is non-zero, circumflex can never match if the PCRE_MULTILINE option is unset.<br>
    Inside a character class, circumflex has an entirely different meaning<br>
    Circumflex need not be the first character of the pattern if a number of alternatives are involved.
 <li> $ <br>
    The dollar character is an assertion that is true only if the current matching point is at the end of the subject string, or <i>immediately</i> before a newline at the end of the string.<br>
    The meaning of dollar can be changed so that it matches only at the very end of the string, by setting the PCRE_DOLLAR_ENDONLY option.
 <li> . FULL STOP (PERIOD, DOT)<BR>
    If the PCRE_DOTALL option is set, a dot matches any one character. If the two-character sequence CRLF is present in the subject string, it takes two dots to match it.
 <li> | VERTICAL BAR<br>
    Any number of alternatives may appear, and an empty alternative is permitted
