    <title> escape one character  </title>
</head>
<body>
There is no restriction on the appearance of non-printing characters, <b>apart from the binary zero that terminates a pattern</b>, but when a pattern is being prepared by text editing, it is often easier to use one of the following escape sequences than the binary character it represents
<ul>
  <li>\a    alarm, that is, the BEL character (hex 07); also for C(++)
  <li>\b    the backspace character (hex 08); only in character class; when outside, it does not means a character, instead it asserts a word boundary
  <li>\cx   "control-x", where x is any ASCII character; if x is a lower case letter, it is converted to upper case. Then bit 6 of the character (hex 40) is inverted. Thus \cA to \cZ become hex 01 to hex 1A (A is 41, Z is 5A), but \c{ becomes hex 3B ({ is 7B), and \c; becomes hex 7B (; is 3B). If the data item following \c has a value greater than 127, a compile-time error occurs(This locks out non-ASCII characters)
  <li>\e    the escape(hex 1B)
  <li>\f    form feed (hex 0C)
  <li>\n    linefeed (hex 0A)
  <li>\r    carriage return (hex 0D)
  <li>\t    tab (hex 09)
  <li>\0dd  character with octal code 0dd; After \0 up to two further octal digits are read. If there are fewer than two digits, just those that are present are used. Thus the sequence \0\x\015 specifies two binary zeros followed by a CR character (code value 13). For greater clarity and unambiguity, it is best to avoid following \ by a digit greater than zero. Instead, use \o{} or \x{} to specify character numbers, and \g{} to specify back references.
  <li>\ddd  character with octal code ddd, or back reference
  <li>\o{ddd..} The escape \o must be followed by a sequence of octal digits, enclosed in braces. An error occurs if this is not the case. This escape is a recent addition to Perl; it provides way of specifying character code points as octal numbers greater than 0777
  <li>\xhh  character with hex code hh (letters can be in upper or lower case).
  <li>\x{hhh..} character with hex code hhh.. (non-JavaScript mode); If a character other than a hexadecimal digit appears between \x{ and }, or if there is no terminating }, an error occurs. 
  <li>\uhhhh    character with hex code hhhh (JavaScript mode only)
</ul>

<p>The handling of a backslash followed by a digit other than 0(\ddd from) is complicated, and Perl has changed in recent releases, causing PCRE also to change. Outside a character class, PCRE reads the digit and any following digits as a decimal number. If the number is less than 8, or if there have been at least that many previous capturing left parentheses in the expression, the entire sequence is taken as a back reference.

<p>Inside a character class, or if the decimal number following \ is greater than 7 and there have not been that many capturing subpatterns, PCRE handles \8 and \9 as the literal characters "8" and "9", and otherwise re-reads up to three octal digits following the backslash, using them to generate a data character. Any subsequent digits stand for themselves.

<p> For example(when outside character class):  <ul>
 <li>\40    if there are fewer than 40 previous capturing subpatterns, means the ASCII space(4*8+0)
 <li>\7     is always a back reference
 <li>\81    is either a back reference to group 81, or the two characters "8" and "1"
</ul>
