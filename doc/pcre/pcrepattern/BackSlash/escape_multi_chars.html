<body><h1> Newline sequences  </h1>
<P> \R is equivalent to a atomic group (?>\r\n|\n|\x0b|\f|\r|\x85) . This particular group matches either the two-character sequence CR followed by LF, or one of the single characters LF (linefeed, U+000A), VT (vertical tab, U+000B), FF (form feed, U+000C), CR (carriage return, U+000D), or NEL (next line, U+0085).

<p> It is possible to restrict \R to match only CR, LF, or CRLF by setting the option PCRE_BSR_ANYCRLF &#65288;"backslash R"&#65289;

<p> As \R may means a sequence, so \R is not special in character class(it instead means exactly the R char)

<h1> Extended grapheme clusters </h1>
<p>shall not compile if use \X in non-Unicode mode; while in character class, it exactly means the X char
