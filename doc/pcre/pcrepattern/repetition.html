    <title> REPETITION  </title>

<body>
<p> The general repetition quantifier specifies a minimum and maximum number of permitted matches, by giving the two numbers in curly brackets (braces), separated by a comma. The numbers must be less than 65536.

<p> If the second number is omitted, but the comma is present, there is no upper limit(zxxu: not like the general repetition which has the limit as 65536); if the second number and the comma are both omitted, the quantifier specifies an exact number of required matches.

<p> An opening curly bracket that appears in a position where a quantifier is not allowed, or one that does not match the syntax of a quantifier, is taken as a literal character. For example, {,6} is not a quantifier, but a literal string of four characters. 

<p><i>The quantifier {0} is permitted, causing the expression to behave as if the previous item and the quantifier were not present. This may be useful for subpatterns that are referenced as subroutines from elsewhere in the pattern (but see also the section entitled "Defining subpatterns for use by reference only" below). Items other than subpatterns that have a {0} quantifier are omitted.</i>

<p>By default, the quantifiers are "greedy", that is, they match as much as possible (up to the maximum number of permitted times), <b>without causing the rest of the pattern to fail. </b>

<p> However, if a quantifier is followed by a question mark, it ceases to be greedy, and instead matches the minimum number of times possible, so the pattern
<pre>
  /\*.*?\*/
</pre>
does the right thing with the C comments. The meaning of the various quantifiers is not otherwise changed, just the preferred number of matches. Do not confuse this use of question mark with its use as a quantifier in its own right. Because it has two uses, it can sometimes appear doubled, as in
<pre>
  \d??\d
</pre>
which matches one digit by preference, but can match two if that is the only way the rest of the pattern matches. 

<p>If the PCRE_UNGREEDY option is set, the quantifiers are not greedy by default, but individual ones can be made greedy by following them with a question mark. <b>In other words, it inverts the default behaviour. </b>

<p>When a capturing subpattern is repeated, the value captured is the substring that matched the final iteration. For example, after
<pre>
  (tweedle[dume]{3}\s*)+
</pre>
has matched "tweedledum tweedledee" the value of the captured substring is "tweedledee". However, if there are nested capturing subpatterns, the corresponding captured values may have been set in previous iterations. 

<h1>ATOMIC GROUPING AND POSSESSIVE QUANTIFIERS</h1>
With both maximizing ("greedy") and minimizing ("ungreedy" or "lazy") repetition, failure of what follows normally causes the repeated item to be re-evaluated to see if a different number of repeats allows the rest of the pattern to match. Sometimes it is useful to prevent this, either to change the nature of the match, or to cause it fail earlier than it otherwise might, when the author of the pattern knows there is no point in carrying on.

<p>Consider, for example, the pattern \d+foo when applied to the subject 123456bar, after matching all 6 digits and then failing to match "foo", the normal action of the matcher is to try again with only 5 digits matching the \d+ item, and then with 4, and so on, before ultimately failing.

<p>"Atomic grouping" provides the means for specifying that once a subpattern has matched, it is not to be re-evaluated in this way.  If we use atomic grouping for the previous example, the matcher gives up immediately on failing to match "foo" the first time:<pre>
  (?>\d+)foo
</pre>
This kind of parenthesis "locks up" the part of the pattern it contains once it has matched, and a failure further into the pattern is prevented from backtracking into it. <b>An alternative description is that a subpattern of this type matches the string of characters that an identical standalone pattern would match, if anchored at the current point in the subject string.</b>

<p> <b>Atomic grouping subpatterns are not capturing subpatterns</b>. Simple cases such as the above example can be thought of as a maximizing repeat that must swallow everything it can. So, while both \d+ and \d+? are prepared to adjust the number of digits they match in order to make the rest of the pattern match, (?>\d+) can only match an entire sequence of digits(zxxu: if PCRE_UNGREEDY not set). 

<p> Atomic groups in general can of course contain arbitrarily complicated subpatterns, and can be nested. However, when the subpattern for an atomic group is just a single repeated item, as in the example above, a simpler notation, called a "possessive quantifier" can be used. <i>This consists of an additional + character following a quantifier</i>. Using this notation, the previous example can be rewritten as  \d++foo

<p>Note that a possessive quantifier can be used with an entire group, for example:
<pre>
  (abc|xyz){2,3}+
</pre>
Possessive quantifiers are always greedy; the setting of the PCRE_UNGREEDY option is yet affecting atomic grouping.<pre style=color:red>
if pattern "(?>\d+)$" compiled with PCRE_UNGREEDY running against subject "123", pcre_exec match at position 2:
it firstly try matching 1$ but failed;
then it try position 1 with 2$, failed again;
at last it proceeds to postion 2 and 3$ matched
