It is also possible to refer to subsequently opened parentheses, by writing references such as (?+2). However, these cannot be recursive because the reference is not inside the parentheses that are referenced. They are always non-recursive subroutine calls

<P>An alternative approach is to use named parentheses like (?&name) or (?P>name).
