<ul>
<li>If the minimum repetition is greater than zero, 8.12 report error(such as for (?=your_look_aheads){1,2}, it reports `nothing to repeat`); while latest versions obey it once
<li>If quantifier is {0,n} where n is greater than zero, it is treated as if it were {0,1}. At run time, the rest of the pattern match is tried with and without the assertion, the order depending on the greediness of the quantifier.
<li>If quantifier is {0},  the assertion is never obeyed, yet following example shows this kind of quantifier is useful when defining groups:<pre>
(?x) #defined PCRE_EXTENDED, so comments, white spaces and new lines are allowed from now on


(?:
 ( a(?=(b)) ) {0}

 (?2)
)

#g1 will never be obeyed, yet insided it we defined g2
#assertion subpatterns don't consume, so it can't be repeated with {} for 8.12; yet g1 can be repeated
#(?2) is calling instead of capturing the group
#at last, for subject "cb", the whole pattern can't be matched at pos 0, but can be at pos 1
</pre>
</ul>
