<h1> 32-bit (called single precision) number </h1>
  <h3>format: Sign=1bits; Exponent=8bits, must be biased with 127 when calc actual value, <b style=color:red>or 126 for denormalized finites</b>; Significand|Mantissa|Coefficient=23bits, with implied 1 for normalized finites while 0 for subnormals</h3>

  <h3>explanations</h3>
  <li>The smallest normalized finite which is larger than 0 is represented as: S=0, E=1, Sig=1.0; which is interpreted as 1.0*pow2(1-127)=pow2(-126)
  <li>The largest subnormal which is larger than 0 is represented as: S=0, E=0, Sig=0.11...1, which is NEARLY eaqual with 1.0*pow2(0-127)? <b style=color:red>No, the standard re-interpret it as NEARLY 1.0*pow2(1-127), which is pow2(-126)-pow2(-149)</b>
  <li>The smallest subnormal which is larger than 0 is represented as: S=0, E=0, Sig=0.00...1, which is pow2(-23)*pow2(-126)=pow2(-149)
  <li>The largest normalized finite is (2-pow2(-23))*pow2(127)=pow2(128)-pow2(114)
<h1> 64-bit (called double precision) number </h1>
The standard allocates 1 bit for sign, 11 bits for the exponent, and 52 bits for the significand. The exponent uses a biased representation with a bias of 1023 = pow(2, NUM_OF_EXPONENT_BITS -1) - 1
