<h1> Introduction </h1>
<a href=https://tlsh.org/>TLSH</a> is an impl of LSH(local/partial changes sensitive hash) invented by the famous anti-virus company TrendMicro, this hash should have been mature as it's adopted by:<ul>
<li> VirusTotal (https://developers.virustotal.com/v3.0/reference#files-tlsh)
<li> Malware Bazaar (https://bazaar.abuse.ch/)
<li> MISP (https://www.misp-project.org/)
<li> STIX: https://docs.oasis-open.org/cti/stix/v2.1/stix-v2.1.html
</ul>

<p>Open source of TLSH can be found at <a href=https://github.com/trendmicro/tlsh>here</a>; explanations of algos, tests, and analysises can be found besides the source code in the doc named TLSH_CTC_final.pdf

<h1> Internals </h1>
Check following internals if you're interested:<ul>

    <li> <a href=Configs.html> (CMake) Configs </a>

    <li> <a href=update.html>Feed data and update the hash bin</a>

    <li> <a href=final.html>Finalize updates of the hash bin</a>

    <li> <a href=distance.html>Get get distance between hashes</a>

    <li> <a href=tlsh_unittest.html>unit tests</a>

</ul>

<h1> Advantages </h1><ol>
<li><b style=color:green>Reodering text paragraphs still results in small TLSH distance;</b> By its definition, LSH is only sensitive to local changes, but TLSH get good rusults; You can prove it yourself with my provided bin&dat(or data from yourself ) by following command:<pre>
TLSH/bin/tlsh_unittest -c data/ShortcomingsOfSomeLshAlgos.html -f data/ShortcomingsOfSomeLshAlgos.swap_paragraphs
</pre>
<li>Support flow update of the hash result(proivde TlshImpl::update which likes MD5_Update)
<li>Support different sized files mapping to same hashe value(unless the -xlen option not specified)
</ol>

<h1> Disadvantages </h1><ol>
<li>Having size limit(if TLSH_OPTION_CONSERVATIVE not set, file must be at least 256 bytes to produce its hash; else 50 bytes)
<li>Original file which has too small entropy can't produce its hash(leads to sparse bucket slots, to say, too many invalid slots)
<li>TLSH codes may can't be groupped in efficient way<i><br>
 <p>ideally, if hash codes can be sorted by linear values in each of its dimension, such that if for any hash values(1-dimensions assumed) HashI , HashJ and HashK,<br>
   if (cmp(HashI,HashJ) > 0 && cmp(HashJ,HashK) > 0), we can assert cmp(HashI,HashK) > 0,
 then the codes can be searched efficiently
 
 <p>in reality, sequencable hash may don't exists, but hash codes <b style=color:red>can</b> be groupped in efficient way</i> is still required for performance reason
