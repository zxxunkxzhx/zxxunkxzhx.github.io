<h1> Introduction </h1>
Bison CAN convert an context-free grammar(CFG, any grammar expressed in a superset of BNF is a context-free grammar) into a <b>deterministic LR parser</b> employing any mode of the following: <ul>
<li> LALR(1) <b>parser tables</b>: Bison uses Look-Ahead LR tables by default
<li> <b>Canonical LR(1)</b> parser tables: Can handle all LR(1) grammars but rarely used because they can be very large
<li> <b>IELR(1)</b> parser tables: Inadequacy Elimination LR tables provide the same parsing power as canonical but tries to retain the compactness of LALR(1) tables.
</ul>

<p>any mode of LR(1) tables are deterministic, they make parsing decisions with 1(a single) lookahead token and follow a <b>single</b> path; <i style=color:green>zxxu: in v3.8.1 "5.2 Shift/Reduce Conflicts", bison said `IF stmt1 ELSE stmt2` has SR  conflicts with `IF stmt1`, so the grammar is ambiguous, yet we say LALR(1) mode of bison is(looks) deterministic because bison can always make decision( prefer longest match, use precedence directives, etc)</i>

<p>For grammars that are ambiguous, bison can generate a GLR(generalized LR) parser which can explore multiple parse paths simultaneously and resolve ambiguity <i>based on additional tokens or ...</i>; 

<p>all properly-written Yacc grammars ought to work with Bison with no change.

<h1> Visualizing Your Parser </h1>
using --graph to produce a DOT file ending with .gv(for old bison, .dot), you will need `apy -y install graphviz` to use the <i>dot</i> command( or use online tools at https://www.devtoolsdaily.com/ and optionally `apy -y install xdot` to render the DOT file locally.

<p>Besides --verbose for textual output and --graph for DOT output, another
alternative is to output an XML(--xml[=FILE]) file that may then be, with xsltproc(apt -y install xsltproc), rendered as either
a raw text format equivalent to the verbose file, or as an HTML version of the same file,
with clickable transitions, or even as a DOT. The .output and DOT files obtained via
XSLT have no difference whatsoever with those obtained by invoking bison with options
--verbose or --graph.

<p>following is the steps to produce a html output:<ol>
<li> bison -d --verbose --warnings=all --xml data_swap_demo.y
<li> // bison --print-datadir --> /usr/share/bison
<li> xsltproc /usr/share/bison/xslt/xml2xhtml.xsl data_swap_demo.xml    >data_swap_demo.html
</ol>

<p>to produce DOT file, change xml2xhtml into xml2dot

<h1> Tracing Your Parser </h1>
There are several means to enable compilation of trace facilities, in decreasing order of
preference:<ul>
<li>-Dparse.trace
<li>--debug to define YYDEBUG (to 1); to be compliant with yacc , use -t instead
<li>put '#define YYDEBUG 1' in the prologue of the grammar file
</ul>

<p>In C the trace facility outputs messages with macro calls of the form YYFPRINTF (stderr, format, args).

<p>Once you have compiled the program with trace facilities, the way to request a trace is to store a nonzero value in the variable yydebug. You can do this by making the C code do it (in main, perhaps), or you can alter the value with a C debugger.

<p>zxxu: the best practice is `bison --debug` and in your C code write:<pre>
#if YYDEBUG==1
yydebug = 1;
#else
yydebug = 0;
#endif

then everytime when you wanna trace, call YYFPRINTF
</pre>
