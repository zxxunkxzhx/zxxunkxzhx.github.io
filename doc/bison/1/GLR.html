<h1> the %glr-parser option </h1>
//glr parsers handle Bison grammars that contain no conflicts(after applying precedence declarations) identically to deterministic parsers.

<p>when faced with conflicts, GLR parsers effectively cloning the parser to follow both possibilities.

<p>Each of the resulting parsers can again split, so that at any given time, there can be any number of possible parses being explored.

<p>The parsers proceed in <b>lockstep</b>; that is, all of them consume (shift) a given input symbol before any of them proceed to the next.

<p>Each of the cloned parsers eventually meets one of two possible fates: either it runs into a parsing error, in which case it simply vanishes, or it merges with another parser, because
the two of them have reduced the input to an identical set of symbols.

<p>During the time that there are multiple parsers, semantic actions are recorded but not performed.

<p>When a reduction makes two parsers identical, causing them to merge, Bison records both sets of semantic actions.

<p>Whenever the last two parsers merge, reverting to the single-parser case, Bison resolves all the outstanding actions either by precedences given to the grammar rules involved, or by performing both actions, and then calling a
designated user-defined function on the resulting values to produce an arbitrary merged result.

<h1> Using GLR on Unambiguous Grammars </h1>
<p>In the simplest cases, you can use the GLR algorithm to parse grammars that are unambiguous but fail to be LR(1). Such grammars typically require more than one symbol of lookahead.
